### üßæ Introduction
- One of the key challenges in autonomous driving is safely navigating areas with occluded pedestrians and vehicles.
- Prior methods used phantom vehicle generation to estimate risk but were often overly conservative or ineffective in real time under heavy occlusion.
- To address this, we propose an efficient occlusion-aware risk assessment framework and a risk-adaptive speed control strategy.
### ‚öôÔ∏è Method
- The proposed method models phantom agents in occluded regions using a simplified probabilistic reachability distribution.
- Based on the quantified risk of phantom agents, the system dynamically sets speed limits to enable safe yet efficient navigation.
- The approach maintains constant-time complexity and is computationally efficient, requiring less than 5 ms per decision.
### ‚úÖ Result
- Simulation results show the proposed method increased intersection traversal time by 1.48√ó,
but reduced average collision rate and discomfort score by 6.14√ó and 5.03√ó, respectively.
- The method achieves state-of-the-art time efficiency while significantly improving safety and ride comfort in occluded scenarios.
